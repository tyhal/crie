**Target Users:**

Hobby Projects:

* Quick start with zero configuration - just run and code, perfect for weekend projects where you don't want to spend time on tooling setup

Multilanguage Developers:

* Single consistent interface across all languages - no need to remember different lint commands or tool configurations for each language

Large Projects with Many Contributors:

* Containerized tooling means no local setup headaches - new team members don't need to spend a day installing and configuring various linters

Small Teams Without DevOps Resources:

* Get code quality checks without the overhead of maintaining multiple tools and configurations

Legacy Project Maintainers:

* Drop-in quality controls for existing codebases without disrupting current workflows or requiring extensive refactoring

Monorepo Owners:

* Single tool to handle all languages in your repository - from documentation to infrastructure code to applications

Full-Stack Developers:

* Same linting workflow whether you're writing frontend JavaScript, backend Go, or infrastructure Terraform code
